  \frametitle{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Previous results on total energy shaping lacked a formal proof of
    stability.
  \item Energy shaping can be used to add robustness to hybrid mechanical
    systems.
  \item The limiting behavior of the original system and controller is
    maintained.
  \item It has been shown formally that stability is maintained for small enough
    control gains.
  \end{itemize}
