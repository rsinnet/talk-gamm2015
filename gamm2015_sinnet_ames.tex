This presentation discusses a class of methods known collectively as {\em energy
  shaping}.
%
These methods share the common approach of utilizing the structure of energy to
create stabilizing controllers for periodic behaviors in dynamical systems.
%
The primary focus is on a recent method which provides an optimal controller for
stabilizing the energy dynamics of periodic behaviors in hybrid mechanical
system while maintaining exponential stability of the overall hybrid system.
%
The principles involved rely on the well-developed analytical mechanics methods
of Lagrange as well as the body of literature on stability which centers around
the ideas presented by Lyapunov.
% 
Through the use of control Lyapunov functions, this method seeks to shape
the energy dynamics of a system while providing a formal guarantee on stability.
% 
In particular, given a hybrid system with an exponentially stable limit
cycle representing a periodic behavior, the application of energy shaping
will exponentially stabilize the energy dynamics to a specified reference
level while maintaining exponential stability of the overall hybrid system.
% 
The presented control strategy is applicable to a wide class of mechanical
systems including bipedal locomotion.
% 
Moreover, the controller involves an optimization problem which is formulated as
a quadratic program operating on a convex set, thereby permitting the use of
existing tools for rapidly evaluating the solution.
% 
%Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the application and
%usefulness of energy shaping.

% 
The ideas herein build on existing results spread throughout the literature.
%
Over the last few decades, researchers have presented control schemes which seek
to achieve periodic behaviors in dynamical systems by formulating their control
objectives in terms of the energy of a system.
%
Based on McGeer's observation that compass-gait bipeds with appropriate mass
distributions can walk down shallow slopes without actuation \cite{McGeer1990},
Spong presented controlled symmetries \cite{Spong2005} as a method for obtaining
walking on a compass-gait biped on flat ground by injecting energy in a such a
way that the shaped potential energy of the robot's gait on flat ground mimicked
the potential energy of a passive biped walking down a slope.
% 
Based on this idea, Spong later provided a controller which could shape the
total energy of a compass-gait biped and showed that the controller would
guarantee asymptotic stability of the energy dynamics to a reference level
through the continuous dynamics.
%
He later demonstrated how the ideas could be extended to non-conservative
systems \cite{Spong2007} by considering energy storage functions.
%
Similarly, the authors of this presentation have extended Spong's ideas on
controlled symmetries to three-dimensional bipeds through the use of functional
Routhian reduction \cite{Grizzle2014}.


The problem of interest in this paper falls under a class of problems involving
stability of systems with zero dynamics.
%
In \cite{Ames2014}, a similar problem was considered in which a stabilizing
control law was constructed using control Lyapunov functions to stabilize to a
zero dynamics which exhibited hybrid invariance; that is, for initial conditions
on the intersection of the switching surface and the hybrid zero dynamics
manifold, application of the reset map will result in a state which is still on
the hybrid zero dynamics.
%
This was a key assumption underlying \cite{Ames2014} but this assumption does
not hold for energy shaping as energy is generally not invariant through impact,
though there may be pathological examples which demonstrate this property.
%
In fact, for certain conservative systems like the compass-gait biped, which
exhibits local exponential stability, energy change can only occur through
discrete transitions and so impacts actually act as a stabilizing influence.
%
%Another key difference is the assumption of stability which is necessary for the
%application of energy shaping.
%
%Whereas \cite{Ames2014} requires stability of the system for states restricted
%to the hybrid zero dynamics, this paper requires stability of the nominal system
%and does not require hybrid invariance of the zero dynamics.
%
%Thus, while the problems are somewhat similar, they also have their differences
%and are applicable to different types of systems.
